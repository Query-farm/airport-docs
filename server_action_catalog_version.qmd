title: "`catalog_version` Action"
---

This `catalog_version` action is used to determine the current version of the database provided by an Arrow Flight server.  By indicating that a catalog version has changed, DuckDB refreshes the contents the database's schemas rather than using cached data.

## Input Parameters

The name of the database is passed as a string to the action.

## Output Result.

There is a single `msgpack` expected result from the action.

```c++
struct GetCatalogVersionResult
{
  uint64_t catalog_version;
  bool is_fixed;
  MSGPACK_DEFINE(catalog_version, is_fixed)
};
```

If the `is_fixed` field is true, DuckDB will cache the returned catalog version and never query the Arrow Flight server for it again during the current DuckDB session.
