1. Could Airport be implemented without Arrow Flight?

    Yes, but using REST would limit features that require bi-directional data flow. However, since Airport relies on gRPC, it is not currently compatible with WebAssembly or browser environments.

2. Why is `msgpack` used rather than JSON?

    `msgpack` allows binary data to be included in its serialization where JSON does not since JSON is UTF-8 encoded.

3. Does the Airport extention work with Webassembly/WASM?

    It does not at this time because it has a dependency on gRPC and protobuf.
