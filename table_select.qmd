title: "Select from Tables"
---

The Airport extension enables DuckDB to query remote data using standard `SELECT` statements. Through Arrow Flight integration, data can be either streamed directly or accessed via returned locations (such as URLs to Parquet files). Arrow Flight servers may optionally filter results server-side using query predicates before returning data.

## Example

You can query Airport-managed tables just like any other DuckDB table:

```sql
-- Attach an Airport database
ATTACH 'example' (TYPE AIRPORT, location 'grpc://localhost:50312/');

-- Assume that there is a `main` schema
-- already in the `example` database
CREATE TABLE example.main.employees (
  name varchar,
  id integer
);

SELECT * FROM example.main.employees;

-- Queries that specify a point in time
-- or version of the table are supported, if
-- the Arrow flight server supports it.
SELECT * FROM example.main.employees AT (TIMESTAMP => TIMESTAMP '2020-01-01');
SELECT * FROM example.main.employees AT (VERSION => 42);
```

Airport tables can be joined with other tables or combined with multiple Airport sources in a single query. DuckDB fetches data in parallel, limited only by the available thread pool size. Each reference to a table results in an independent request to the Arrow Flight server.

## Arrow Flight Server Implementation Notes

### DuckDB Catalog Integration

To learn how to register an Arrow Flight data as a DuckDB table, refer to [Server Catalog Integration](server_catalog_integration.qmd).

### Time Travel / Point in Time Lookup

When a query includes time travel or point-in-time semantics, the Airport extension issues a [`flight_info`](server_action_flight_info.qmd) RPC. This retrieves the `FlightInfo` structure representing the table as it existed at that specific moment in time. This ensures that queries reflect the correct schema, even if the table has evolved over time.


### Endpoint and Location Lookup

To retrieve data from a flight, the Airport extension uses a `DoAction` RPC with the [`endpoints`](server_action_endpoints.qmd) action instead of the standard `GetFlightInfo` RPC.

**Reasons for using `DoAction`:**

1. **Schema already known** — The table schema is cached from catalog discovery, eliminating redundant schema transfers.
2. **Predicate pushdown** — Filter predicates can be serialized and sent to the server, enabling server-side filtering. The standard `GetFlightInfo` RPC only accepts a `FlightDescriptor` without additional context.
