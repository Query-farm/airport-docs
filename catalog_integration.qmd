Each DuckDB session maintains its own catalog, which can contain multiple databases. Each database forms the root of a hierarchy that includes schemas, tables, and functions. The diagram below shows the default hierarchy for a DuckDB session using an in-memory database: a single database containing one schema, which in turn can hold multiple tables and functions. The diagram is intended to help you understand the relationships between sessions, databases, schemas, tables, and functions.

```{.d2 width="80%" echo=false}
DuckDB: {
  label: "An in-memory DuckDB database"

  style: {
    fill: "#FFF4EC"
  }

  \"memory\" Database {
    style: {
      fill: "#D9ABAB"
    }
    \"main\" Schema {
      style:  {
        fill: "#D3C2D6"
      }
      Table {
        label: "Tables"
        style: {
          multiple: true
        }
      }
      ScalarFunction {
        label: "Scalar Functions"
        style: {
          multiple: true
        }

      }
      TableReturningFunction {
        label: "Table Returning Functions"
        style: {
          multiple: true
        }

      }
    }
  }
}

The Airport extension allows databases to be attached to the current DuckDB session, similar to how [PostgreSQL](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/postgres.html#connecting) and [SQLite](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/sqlite.html#usage) databases can be attached to a DuckDB session.

::: {.callout-note}
As of DuckDB version 1.2.0, attached databases are not persisted in an on-disk DuckDB database. This means they need to be reattached for each session.
:::

An Airport server-provided database can be attached using an [`ATTACH`](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/attach.html) statement:

__Example:__

```sql
ATTACH 'database_name' (
  TYPE AIRPORT,
  LOCATION 'grpc://localhost:12345/'
);
```

Airport retrieves information about an attached database or schema only when an object within it is first referenced. This allows the ATTACH command to run quickly.

## Attaching an Airport Database

To attach a database provided by Airport execute a SQL `ATTACH` statement with the necessary information that provides the name of the database to attach and the URL of the Arrow Flight server.

```sql
ATTACH 'airport_database_name' (
  TYPE AIRPORT,
  LOCATION 'grpc://localhost:12345/'
);
```

::: {.callout-tip}
Arrow Flight servers can provide multiple databases at the same location or URL.  It is important to match the target database name expected by the server.  The database can be renamed in DuckDB [by using an alias](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/attach.html).
:::

__Attach Arguments:__

| Argument | Type | Description |
|--------|---|-------------------------------|
| type | `VARCHAR` | This must always be the value `AIRPORT`. |
| location | `VARCHAR` | This is the location of the Flight server. Typically this will be of the form `grpc://$HOST:PORT` or `grpc+tls://$HOST:$PORT` |
| secret | `VARCHAR` | This is the name of the [DuckDB secret](https://duckdb.org/docs/configuration/secrets_manager.html) to use to supply the value for the `auth_token`. |
| auth_token | `VARCHAR` | A bearer value token to present to the server, the header is formatted like `Authorization: Bearer <auth_token>` |

Once a database has been attached the tables will be visible in either `SHOW ALL TABLES` or `SELECT * from duckdb_tables()`.

To make the tables accessible without using full qualification in the queries you may want to update the search path to include the newly attached database as shown in the following example:

```sql
SET search_path = 'example,airport_database_name';
SELECT * FROM tbl1;
SELECT * FROM tbl2;
```

This example would find `tbl1` or `tbl2` if they are defined in either the `example` database or the `airport_database_name` database.

## Arrow Flight Server Implementation Notes

For information about how to register an Arrow Flight as an object in the DuckDB catalog refer to [Server Catalog Integration](server_catalog_integration.qmd).
