---

The Airport extension supports dropping tables through standard SQL `DROP TABLE` statements. The Arrow Flight server determines whether to permit the table deletion.

## Example

To drop a table, execute a standard SQL `DROP TABLE` statement referencing a schema managed by the Airport extension.

```sql
-- Attach an Airport database
ATTACH 'example' (TYPE AIRPORT, location 'grpc://localhost:50312/');

DROP TABLE example.main.employees;
```

## Arrow Flight Server Implementation Notes

The Airport extension will perform a `DoAction` Arrow Flight RPC with a method name of [`drop_table`](server_action_drop_table.qmd).
