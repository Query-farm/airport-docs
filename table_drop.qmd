title: "Drop"
---

The Airport extension supports dropping tables. The Arrow Flight server determines whether to drop the table.

## Example

For a DuckDB session to drop a table, a standard SQL `DROP TABLE ` statement is executed in a schema that is managed by the Airport extension.

```sql
-- Attach an Airport database
ATTACH 'example' (TYPE AIRPORT, location 'grpc://localhost:50312/');

DROP TABLE example.main.employees;
```

## Arrow Flight Server Implementation Notes

The Airport extension will perform a `DoAction` Arrow Flight RPC with a method name of [`drop_table`](server_action_drop_table.qmd).
