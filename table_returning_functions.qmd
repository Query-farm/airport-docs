title: "Table Returning Functions"
---

The Airport extension for DuckDB supports having Arrow Flight servers provide table returning functions.  Table returning functions are SQL functions that return an arbitrary number of rows conforming to a schema.  The schema can be dynamically defined based on the input to the function.

## Example

An example of a SQL query with a table returning function is:

```sql
SELECT * from custom_function('arg1');
```

In addition to taking scalar parameters table returning functions can be what are called "in-out" functions, where can they receive the output of another query as an input.

An example of calling an "in-out" table returning function is:

```sql
SELECT * from in_out_function('arg1',
 (SELECT * from employees where name ilike 'R%')
);
```

The rows from the `employees` table will be sent incrementally to Arrow Flight server.

## Arrow Flight Server Implementation Notes

### DuckDB Catalog Integration

For information about how to register an Arrow Flight as a table returning function refer to [Server Catalog Integration](server_catalog_integration.html).

### Supporting the `ANY` DuckDB Data Type

If you wish to use the DuckDB ANY datatype, create a standard Arrow field in a schema, but add additional metadata with the name of `is_any_type` with a non empty table.  The Airport extension will treat that column as being defined as the `ANY` type.

### Schemas for Table Returning In-Out Functions

If the table returning function is desired to be an "in-out" function, there must be one and only one field in the Arrow input schema with a metadata key named `is_table_type`  with a non empty string value.  This column will be treated as the `TABLE` DuckDB data type by the Airport extension.

### Implementation

The Airport extension does two different things, depending if the table returning function is an "in-out" function or not.

#### Regular Table Returning Function

When the table returning function is called.  The Airport extension will make a `DoAction` Arrow Flight RPC to the server with an action named [`table_function_flight_info`](server_action_table_function_flight_info.qmd) to obtain a `FlightInfo` which will then be called with the `DoGet` Arrow Flight RPC method.  It is expected the server may interpret the parameters and return a new schema or otherwise encode the parameters in the returned `ticket` field of the `FlightInfo`.

#### In-Out Table Function

In the case of an "in-out" table returning function a `DoExchange` Arrow RPC is made.

The input schema for the `DoExchange` call is the schema of the "in" table.  The serialized parameters to the table returning function are sent an initial metadata message on the `DoExchange` stream.  This message is `msgpack` encoded.

```c++
struct AirportTableFunctionInOutParameters
{
  std::string json_filters;
  std::vector<idx_t> column_ids;

  // The parameters to the table function, which should
  // be included in the opaque ticket data returned
  // for each endpoint.
  std::string parameters;

  std::string at_unit;
  std::string at_value;

  MSGPACK_DEFINE_MAP(json_filters, column_ids, parameters, at_unit, at_value)
};
```

DuckDB will produce rows to send to the in/out function, these will be sent via the `DoExchange` stream as Arrow `RecordBatch` objects.  For each chunk the server should return a `RecordBatch` that may contain zero rows, that `RecordBatch` must be accompanied by metadata that is either set to `chunk_continues` or `chunk_finished` that indicates if there will be more `RecordBatch` objects produced from the currently provided input `RecordBatch`.
