title: "Table Returning Functions"
---

The Airport extension for DuckDB supports having Arrow Flight servers provide table returning functions.  Table returning functions are SQL functions that return an arbitrary number of rows conforming to a schema.  The schema can be dynamically defined based on the input to the function.

## Example

An example of a SQL query with a table returning function is:

```sql
SELECT * from custom_function('arg1');
```

In addition to taking scalar parameters table returning functions can be what are called "in-out" functions, where can they receive the output of another query as an input.

An example of calling an "in-out" table returning function is:

```sql
SELECT * from in_out_function('arg1',
 (SELECT * from employees where name ilike 'R%')
);
```

The rows from the `employees` table will be sent incrementally to Arrow Flight server.

## Arrow Flight Server Implementation Notes

### DuckDB Catalog Integration

For information about how to register an Arrow Flight as a table returning function refer to [Server Catalog Integration](server_catalog_integration.html).

### Supporting the `ANY` DuckDB Data Type

If you wish to use the DuckDB ANY datatype, create a standard Arrow field in a schema, but add additional metadata with the name of `is_any_type` with a non empty table.  The Airport extension will treat that column as being defined as the `ANY` type.

### Schemas for Table Returning In-Out Functions

If the table returning function is desired to be an "in-out" function, there must be one and only one field in the Arrow input schema with a metadata key named `is_table_input`  with a non empty string value.  This column will be treated as the `TABLE` DuckDB data type by the Airport extension.

### Implementation

The Airport extension does two different things, depending if the table returning function is an "in-out" function or not.

#### Regular Table Returning Function

When the table returning function is called.  The Airport extension will make a `DoAction` Arrow Flight RPC call to the server with an action named `table_function_flight_info` to obtain a `FlightInfo` which will then be called with the `DoGet` Arrow Flight RPC method.  It is expected the server may interpret the parameters and return a new schema or otherwise encode the parameters in the returned `ticket` field of the `FlightInfo`.

The `table_function_flight_info` action receive this `msgpack` encoded map of parameters as its input:

```c++
struct GetFlightInfoTableFunctionParameters
{
  std::string schema_name;
  std::string action_name;
  std::string parameters;
  std::string table_input_schema;

  MSGPACK_DEFINE_MAP(schema_name, action_name, parameters, table_input_schema)
};
```

The `parameters` field contains a serialized Arrow Record Batch with the parameter values.  The field names of the record batch are the same as defined by the input schema of the function.

The `table_function_flight_info` is expected to return a single serialized Arrow `FlightInfo` structure, that will then be used to retrieve the data.  The custom action of ``table_function_flight_info` is used because it allows additional data to be serialized compared with the `GetFlightInfo` Arrow RPC method.


#### In-Out Table Function

In the case of an "in-out" table returning function a `DoExchange` Arrow RPC call is made.

The input schema for the `DoExchange` call is the schema of the "in" table.  The serialized parameters to the table returning function are sent an initial metadata message on the `DoExchange` stream.  The parameters are Arrow Record Batch with a single row.

The rows produced by the function are read from the `DoExchange` stream.
