title: "Airport Tables with `RowId` Pseudocolumns"
---

In DuckDB, the [`rowid` pseudocolumn](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/sql/statements/select.html#row-ids) serves as a unique row identifier that is derived from the physical storage of the row.

For native DuckDB tables, this identifier is typically represented as a unique `BIGINT` value.

Tables that are supplied via the Airport extension can optionally include a `rowid` pseudocolumn.

To enable an Airport table to have a `rowid` column, the Arrow schema that defines the table must include a single field where the field's metadata includes a key named `is_rowid` with a non-empty string value.

## Key Constraints and Data Types

- Each table can have at most one `rowid` column.
- The `rowid` column does not have to be of type `BIGINT`; it can be of any Arrow data type.

## Responsibilities of the Arrow Flight Server

The Arrow Flight server is responsible for:

1. Ensuring that the values in the `rowid` column are unique across all endpoints,
2. Properly handling filtering operations based on the `rowid` column.

## Implications of tables without `rowid` columns.

1. DuckDB is not able to perform row-wise `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operations on tables that do not have a `rowid` pseudocolumn.

2. The DuckDB UI does not work well with tables that don't have a `rowid` column as it is hard to scroll through result sets.
