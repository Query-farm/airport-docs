title: "Airport Tables with `rowid` Pseudocolumns"
---

In DuckDB, the [`rowid` pseudocolumn](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/sql/statements/select.html#row-ids) serves as a unique row identifier derived from the physical storage location.

For native DuckDB tables, this identifier is typically a unique `BIGINT` value. Airport-managed tables can optionally provide a `rowid` pseudocolumn with similar functionality.

To enable an Airport table to have a `rowid` column, the Arrow schema that defines the table must include a single field whose metadata contains a key named `is_rowid` with a non-empty string value.

## Key Constraints and Data Types

- Each table can have at most one `rowid` column.
- The `rowid` column does not have to be of type `BIGINT`; it can be of any Arrow data type.

## Responsibilities of the Arrow Flight Server

The Arrow Flight server is responsible for:

1. Ensuring that the values in the `rowid` column are unique across all endpoints,
2. Properly handling filtering operations based on the `rowid` column.

## Implications of Tables Without `rowid` Columns

**Limitations:**

1. **No row-wise modifications** — DuckDB cannot perform `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operations on tables without a `rowid` pseudocolumn.

2. **Poor UI experience** — The DuckDB UI has difficulty scrolling through result sets from tables lacking a `rowid` column, as it relies on row identifiers for efficient pagination.
