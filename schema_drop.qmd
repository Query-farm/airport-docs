title: "Drop"
---

The Airport extension support dropping schemas. The Arrow Flight server can decide if the schema should actually be dropped.

## Example

For a DuckDB session to drop a schema, a standard SQL [`DROP SCHEMA`](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/sql/statements/drop.html) statement is executed in a schema that is managed by the Airport extension.

```sql
-- Attach an Airport database
ATTACH 'example' (TYPE AIRPORT, location 'grpc://localhost:50312/');

DROP SCHEMA example.main;
```

## Arrow Flight Server Implementation Notes

The Airport extension will perform a `DoAction` Arrow Flight RPC with a method name of [`drop_schema`](server_action_drop_schema.qmd).
