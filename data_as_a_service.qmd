The **Airport extension** for DuckDB enables you to build and deliver powerful *Data-as-a-Service* (DaaS) solutions.

## What is Data-as-a-Service?

Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) delivers clean, structured, queryable data over the Internet on demand—similar to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), but for data instead of software. Data consumers don't need to manage infrastructure, storage, or ETL pipelines—they simply connect and start querying.

Leveraging [Arrow Flight](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html), Airport can stream datasets or provide data locations with minimal client-side effort.

### Key Benefits

1. **Zero Infrastructure Burden**
   - Clients only need DuckDB—no custom SDKs or platform dependencies.

2. **Scalable & Real-Time**
   - Efficient data delivery with near real-time updates.

3. **Easy Integration**
   - Seamlessly integrates with applications, dashboards, and analytics platforms.

4. **Flexible Delivery**
   - Clients can query data in place or download it locally using standard [`COPY TO` statements](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/sql/statements/copy.html#copy--to).

5. **Cost Efficiency**
   - Data can be stored in the cloud or on-premises. Clients are automatically directed to the most efficient location. Data can be served from CDNs or streamed directly from Arrow Flight servers as needed.

## Architecture

A typical DaaS deployment using Airport looks like this:

```{.d2 width="90%" echo=false}
direction: right

Clients: {
  shape: person
}

DuckDB: {
  shape: image
  label: ""
  icon: https://duckdb.org/images/logo-dl/DuckDB_Logo-stacked.png
}

Clients -> DuckDB : SQL

LoadBalancer: {
  label: "Load Balancer"
}

DuckDB -> LoadBalancer : "API Calls via\ngRPC using HTTP/2"

LoadBalancer -> ArrowFlightServer

ArrowFlightServer: {
  label: "Arrow Flight Server"
}

DataStore: {
  label: "Data"
  shape: cylinder
}

ArrowFlightServer -> DataStore
```

### Component Overview

1. **DuckDB as the Client**
    - Requires version 1.3.0 or newer. It can run standalone or be embedded.
2. **Load Balancer**
    - Distributes requests across multiple Arrow Flight server instances. Must support HTTP/2.
3. **Arrow Flight Server**
    - Built using any Arrow-compatible language (Python, Java, Rust, C++, Go). Handles query requests.
4. **Data Store**
    - The source of the data. The Arrow Flight server can:
      1. Stream data directly from the server in the [Arrow IPC format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#format-ipc).
      2. Return a [reference via a `data://` URI](table_select.qmd#data-uris-as-endpoint-locations). (e.g., URL to Parquet or CSV on a CDN).


### Additional Elements

These components enhance security, observability, and monetization:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
    - Validate requests and enforce access rules. [Column and row level filtering is possible](server_row_and_column_filtering.qmd).
2. **Observability & Logging**
    - Log all requests for auditing, debugging, and performance insights.
3. **Subscription Management**
    - Enable paid access models by integrating billing with authorization logic.
