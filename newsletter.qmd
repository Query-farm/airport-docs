The **Airport** extension brings [Arrow Flight](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html) support to [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org), allowing you to query remote APIs, serve data securely, and expand DuckDB’s functionality with remote SQL functions.

Whether you’re building Data-as-a-Service platforms or just want more flexible data access — Airport gives DuckDB wings.
