title: "Table Column Statistics"
description: "Provide column-level statistics from Arrow Flight servers to optimize DuckDB query execution with min/max values, distinct counts, and null checks."
---

Arrow Flight servers can optionally provide column-level statistics to improve query execution performance. Statistics may include:

- Minimum and maximum values
- Number of distinct values
- Presence of null or non-null values

These statistics enable DuckDB's query optimizer to make better execution decisions, such as choosing optimal join strategies or filter orderings.

## Arrow Flight Server Implementation Notes

To enable statistics for a table, add a metadata key named `can_produce_statistics` with a non-empty string value to the table's Arrow schema.

When statistics are available, the Airport extension invokes a `DoAction` Arrow Flight RPC with the [`column_statistics`](server_action_column_statistics.qmd) action for each column of interest.
