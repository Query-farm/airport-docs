title: "Building the Airport Extension for DuckDB"
---

To build the Airport extension from source for DuckDB you can follow these instructions.

```sh
# This clones the git repository of the extension.
# duckdb and extension-ci-tools are submodules.
git clone --recursive git@github.com:Query-farm/duckdb-airport-extension

# Clone the vcpkg repo
#
#   vcpkg manages all of the dependencies of the airport extension and is
#   well integrated into DuckDB.
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git

# Bootstrap vcpkg
./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh

# Store the toolchain path for vcpkg, so it can be called
# by the makefiles.
export VCPKG_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=`pwd`/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

# If you have the ninja build tool installed,
# you can use it to speed up the build, otherwise
# just run make by itself.
GEN=ninja make
```

Building the extension will build all of its dependencies, `protobuf`, `grpc`, `arrow` and others, this can take somewhat long time depending on the resources of the system being used to build the extension.

## Alternative to building from source

If you just want to use the extension without building it from source you can install using this SQL command.

```sql
INSTALL airport from community;
LOAD airport;
```
