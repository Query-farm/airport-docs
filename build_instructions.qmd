title: "Building the Airport Extension from Source"
---

Follow these instructions to build the Airport extension from source.

```sh
# Clone the Airport extension repository with submodules
# (includes duckdb and extension-ci-tools)
git clone --recursive git@github.com:Query-farm/duckdb-airport-extension

# Clone vcpkg for dependency management
# vcpkg handles all Airport dependencies and integrates seamlessly with DuckDB
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git

# Bootstrap vcpkg
./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh

# Set the vcpkg toolchain path for the build system
export VCPKG_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=`pwd`/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

# Build the extension
# If you have Ninja installed, use it for faster builds:
GEN=ninja make

# Otherwise, use standard make:
make
```

::: {.callout-note}
Building the extension will compile all dependencies including `protobuf`, `grpc`, `arrow`, and others. Build time varies depending on system resources but typically takes 15-45 minutes on modern hardware.

## Alternative to building from source

If you just want to use the extension without building it from source you can install using this SQL command.

```sql
INSTALL airport from community;
LOAD airport;
```
