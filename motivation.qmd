# The Dream of Universal Data Access via SQL

The Airport extension for DuckDB aims to fulfill a bold vision:
**_"Any data. Anywhere. Accessible via SQL."_**

An imagined user testimonial captures this dream:

> I start my day by launching DuckDB. That’s it. All the data I need is right there—sales data from our websites, inventory and supplier records, server metrics, and even data we license from third-party vendors. I don’t worry about connections or integrations—it's just there. The data stays current automatically, and I can even time travel through it using SQL. Building machine learning models and forecasts is just as seamless. I write a SQL function, and new models are created and updated automatically. When I need to extract data for another system, I use a simple `COPY TO` SQL statement.

### Industry Specific Uses

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Sales

> “When I start my day, I just open DuckDB. Everything’s there — ecommerce sales, inventory, supplier data, server metrics, even vendor feeds. I don't worry about pipelines or syncing. It just works.

For example, to check yesterday’s total revenue:

```sql
SELECT SUM(total_price)
FROM sales_data
WHERE order_date = CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 1 DAY;
```

To identify items low on stock across all warehouses:

```sql
SELECT item_id, SUM(stock) AS total_stock
FROM warehouse_inventory
GROUP BY item_id
HAVING total_stock < 10;
```

When I need to analyze how our supplier performance affects delivery times:

```sql
SELECT supplier_id, AVG(delivery_time)
FROM supplier_orders
WHERE order_status = 'completed'
GROUP BY supplier_id;
```

Even training a forecast model is built into SQL:

```sql
SELECT forecast_sales(product_id, sales_date, quantity_sold)
FROM sales_data;
```

And if I want to export that cleaned dataset for our finance team:

```sql
COPY (SELECT * FROM monthly_financial_summary)
TO 's3://our-bucket/exports/summary.parquet' (FORMAT 'parquet');
```

It’s all just SQL — live, versioned, and automated.


## Finance

> “With DuckDB, I don’t need to wrangle CSVs or deal with third-party tools — I just query. Everything from market data to internal reports is there.

To compute yesterday’s portfolio performance:

```sql
SELECT portfolio_id, SUM(value_change_usd)
FROM trades
WHERE trade_date = CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 1 DAY
GROUP BY portfolio_id;
```

To detect anomalies in wire transfers:

```sql
SELECT account_id, amount, transfer_time
FROM wire_transfers
WHERE amount > 1000000
  AND transfer_time > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL 1 HOUR;
```

To calculate monthly expense ratios:

```sql
SELECT fund_id, SUM(expenses) / SUM(aum) AS expense_ratio
FROM fund_ledger
WHERE month = '2025-04'
GROUP BY fund_id;
```

To publish this for auditors:

```sql
COPY (
  SELECT * FROM expense_ratios_view
) TO 's3://audit-bucket/ratios-2025-04.parquet' (FORMAT 'parquet');
```

I get a modern financial data platform with just SQL.

# Building Toward That Dream

DuckDB is exceptional at single-node analytics and local data querying. Airport extends DuckDB’s power outward, making remote and distributed data sources feel as accessible as local tables. Through Airport, users can query, insert, delete, and functionally interact with remote data sources—without even realizing they aren’t local.

Airport is designed to unlock SQL access to everything from NoSQL databases and legacy systems to modern REST APIs, IMAP, SNMP, Spark, and proprietary vendor systems.

# How This Becomes Reality

SQLite and DuckDB radically simplified SQL by eliminating the need for a database server. While DuckDB continues to add support for modern cloud data formats like Delta Lake and Apache Iceberg, a significant gap remains: bridging the distance between where data lives and making it directly accessible in DuckDB. Entire careers and companies have formed around solving this challenge through complex ETL pipelines.

Airport bridges this gap using [Apache Arrow Flight](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html), a high-performance, RPC-based protocol for exchanging Arrow-formatted data across systems. With Airport, developers can build services that:

- Appear as native DuckDB tables and functions
- Respond to queries using Arrow Flight
- Handle data as streams, not just batches

The result? Distributed data can be queried as if it were a local database table.

Airport isn't just about *reading* remote data—it’s also about providing services and compute logic via SQL-accessible interfaces. You can register functions, expose filtered datasets, even implement custom authorization—all while keeping SQL the user's only interface.


Airport’s seamless connection to remote systems allows users to bypass traditional data extraction and transformation processes, ensuring that queries return fresh, live data. The simplicity of SQL access extends not just to familiar data sources, but to a new world of services like NoSQL databases, legacy systems, and modern cloud platforms.

# Key Ingredients

## DuckDB

DuckDB supports an impressive range of data formats out of the box: CSV, Parquet, Delta Lake, Excel, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and more. But not every source that exists is natively supported, and wrapping each one in a new C++ extension is infeasible.

Airport solves this by abstracting the data interface between the DuckDB and data via Arrow Flight. Developers can implement connectors (a.k.a services/servers) in the language of their choice, decoupled from DuckDB’s internals, and surface the data in DuckDB as needed.

## Apache Arrow

Apache Arrow provides the serialization format underpinning this architecture. Arrow Flight adds gRPC-based transport, enabling efficient data movement across language and system boundaries.

DuckDB already supports reading Arrow data efficiently via the C Data Interface. So when Airport serves Arrow Flight streams to DuckDB, the integration is fast, streaming, and zero-copy where possible.

Arrow's broad ecosystem—C++, Python, Rust, Java, Go, and more—means anyone can build a server that integrates cleanly with Airport.

# Mixing the Ingredients

While the combination of DuckDB and Apache Arrow is powerful, it comes with challenges:

1. Non-relational Data Sources: Some systems, like NoSQL databases or legacy systems, aren’t relational in nature, requiring custom mapping to make them accessible as tables.
2. Efficient Filtering: How to ensure filtering is both efficient and consistent across distributed systems with varying data formats.
3. Authentication and Authorization: Securing access to data across multiple external systems.
4. Failover and Scalability: Ensuring data is available even in the event of service failures or heavy demand.
5. Exposing Functions as Services: Beyond data, Airport also enables the exposure of functions and complex operations from external systems.
6. Data as a Service: Treating data as a service (DaaS), where users can access it without worrying about how it is hosted or transformed.
7. Multiple Services: Airport enables multiple services to coexist and be queried seamlessly, making integration easier.
8. Cost of Data Transfer: Considering the cost implications of querying and transferring large datasets across systems.
9. Transactional Guarantees: Ensuring data consistency across distributed services, especially for transactional workloads.

# The Road Ahead

While Airport has already brought immense power to DuckDB by simplifying access to remote data, we have big plans for the future:

- Expanding Support for More Data Sources: We’re working on integrating even more data formats and services to ensure Airport can access every type of data in your ecosystem.

- Enhanced Documentation and Tools: Expect more robust documentation, tools, and best practices to make integration even easier.

# Conclusion

Airport hopes to redefine how businesses can access and query data, offering SQL-level integration with distributed data services. By removing the need for complex ETL workflows and enabling seamless connectivity, Airport empowers analysts and developers to focus on the insights and decisions that matter, rather than worrying about data pipelines or service integration.

Whether you're in healthcare, finance, ecommerce, or any other data-driven industry, Airport brings the promise of universal data access to life — making it as simple as writing a SQL query.
