title: "`column_statistics` Action"
---

The `column_statitics` action is used to provide DuckDB with statistics about a field in a table. These statistics allow DuckDB to execute queries more efficiently. An Arrow Flight server can optionally choose to implement this action on a table by table basis.

## Input Parameters

There is a single `msgpack` serialized parameter passed to the action.

```c++
struct GetFlightColumnStatistics
{
  std::string flight_descriptor;
  std::string column_name;
  std::string type;

  MSGPACK_DEFINE_MAP(flight_descriptor, column_name, type)
};
```

The `flight_descriptor` field is the Arrow Flight serialized FlightDescriptor structure.

The `type` field is the DuckDB data type name, i.e. `VARCHAR`, `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`.

## Output Results

The response is a Arrow `RecordBatch` serialized using the IPC Format.  The schema of the response should contain these fields.

| Field Name | Type | Description     |
|------------|------|-----------------|
| `has_not_null` | `BOOLEAN` | Indicate if the field contains a value that is not null. |
| `has_null` | `BOOLEAN` | Indicate if the field contains a value that is null. |
| `distinct_count` | `UINT64` | Indicate the number of distinct values in the field. |
| `min` | Depends on column type | The minimum value of the field. |
| `max` | Depends on column type | The maximum value of the field. |
