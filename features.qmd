The Airport extension brings [Arrow Flight](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/10/13/introducing-arrow-flight/) support to DuckDB, enabling high-performance remote data access and distributed operations. Key features are detailed below.

## Key Features

### Supported SQL Operations

**Databases:**

- [`ATTACH`](catalog_integration.qmd#attaching-an-airport-database) — Connect remote databases
- [`DETACH`](catalog_integration.qmd#attaching-an-airport-database) — Disconnect databases

**Tables:**

- [`SELECT`](table_select.qmd) — Query remote tables
- [`UPDATE`](table_update.qmd) — Modify existing data
- [`INSERT`](table_insert.qmd) — Add new data
- [`DELETE`](table_delete.qmd) — Remove data
- [`CREATE TABLE`](table_create.qmd) — Create new tables
- [`DROP`](table_drop.qmd) — Delete tables
- [`ALTER TABLE`](table_alter.qmd) — Modify table structure

**Schemas:**

- [`CREATE SCHEMA`](schema_create.qmd) — Create new schemas
- [`DROP SCHEMA`](schema_drop.qmd) — Delete schemas

### Time Travel

Airport supports time travel queries on tables where the remote system provides this capability. Query historical data snapshots or audit changes over time using standard SQL syntax.

### Custom Scalar Functions (UDFs)

Airport supports custom scalar functions that execute on the remote server. These user-defined functions are registered in the remote schema and behave like native DuckDB functions within queries.

### Table-Returning Functions

Airport supports table-valued functions (TVFs) that accept arguments—including other tables—and return result sets. TVFs enable parameterized queries, dynamic filtering, and complex data pipelines with remote execution.


## Developer Features

### Open Source and MIT Licensed

Airport is freely available under the permissive MIT License.

### Built on Apache Arrow

Airport leverages Apache Arrow and Arrow Flight for:

- High-performance inter-process communication (IPC)
- Efficient streaming across process boundaries
- Multi-language compatibility (Python, Rust, Go, C++, Java, and more)

### Easy to Extend

Airport simplifies the creation of custom Arrow Flight servers with DuckDB-compatible semantics. Connect your data source, expose it via Arrow Flight, and enable SQL queries—no complex integration required.

### Row and Column Level Security

Airport supports fine-grained access controls, including:

- Row-level filtering based on user or session context
- Column-level redaction or exclusion
- Integration with secret managers and policy engines
