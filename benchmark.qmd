This document presents performance benchmarks for core operations using the **Airport** extension for DuckDB. The benchmarks evaluate scalar functions, table creation, and selection operations with both `BIGINT` and 32-byte string data types.

Results are measured in execution time (`duration_sec`), CPU usage (`cpu_sec`), system CPU usage (`cpu_system`), and throughput (rows per second).

All tests were conducted using datasets of 40M to 100M rows, simulating high-throughput analytical workloads typical in production environments.

# Scalar Function Benchmarks

## Echo BIGINT

- **Duration (mean):** 2.06s
- **Rows/sec:** 48.56M
- This represents a nearly zero-cost server side scalar operation, a `BIGINT` is sent to the server and the value is echoed back.

## Add BIGINT

- **Duration (mean):** 3.42s
- **Rows/sec:** 29.27M
- Slightly more expensive than echo, as it performs arithmetic computation, two `BIGINT` values are sent to the server, and a `BIGINT` is returned.

## Echo 32-byte String

- **Duration (mean):** 1.07s
- **Rows/sec:** 37.36M
- High throughput despite operating on 32-byte strings, showing efficient memory handling.

# Remote Table Creation

## Create Remove Table from 32-byte String

- **Duration:** 3.53s
- **Rows/sec:** 11.33M
- Performance reflects single threaded serialization and data transport overhead.

## Create Remote Table from BIGINT

- **Duration:** 12.22s
- **Rows/sec:** 8.18M
- Performance reflects single threaded serialization and data transport overhead.

# Select Queries

## Select from 32-byte String Table

- **Duration (mean):** 1.10s
- **Rows/sec:** 36.21M
- Very fast reads from the remote table, indicating efficient decoding.

## Select from BIGINT Table

- **Duration (mean):** 2.39s
- **Rows/sec:** 41.78M
- Excellent performance, even at scale (100M rows), shows the power of Arrow Flight transport.

# Observations

- **Scalar functions** scale exceptionally well, with `Echo BIGINT` and `Echo 32-byte String` both exceeding 35M rows/sec.
- **Table creation** is the most resource-intensive operation, particularly for large datasets, due to single-threaded insert limitations.
- **Select queries** from remote tables deliver excellent performance, often exceeding 40M rows/sec.
- **System CPU usage** remains low across all operations, indicating efficient kernel-level I/O handling.

# Conclusion

These benchmarks show that the **Airport** extension for DuckDB delivers high throughput and low-latency data access via Apache Arrow Flight, particularly for read-heavy workloads.

It is especially suitable for:

- Real-time analytics
- High-volume batch reads
- Remote function calls with low overhead

Further work may explore concurrency scaling and performance under streaming ingestion.
