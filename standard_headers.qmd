title: "Standard gRPC Headers"
---

The Airport extension sends a standard set of [gRPC headers](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/metadata/) with every request to Arrow Flight servers. These headers provide important context for request routing, authentication, and session tracking.

## Standard Headers

| Header Name | Example Value | Description |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| `airport-user-agent` | `airport/20240820` | User agent identifier including version information. The format is free-form and may be used for protocol compatibility checks. |
| `authority` | `grpc+tls://airport.example.com` | The requested server location. Useful for load balancers and service mesh routing. |
| `airport-client-session-id` | `658A6D08-D1DF-43D7-AC71-9CD15738963F` | A unique UUID generated for each DuckDB session, enabling session tracking and correlation. |
