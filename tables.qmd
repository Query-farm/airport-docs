Tables are fundamental to database systems, representing collections of data organized by rows and associated data types.

Apache Arrow Flight, however, does not natively support the concept of tables. Instead, it handles collections of flights. A flight from an Arrow Flight server can represent a table because it has a fixed schema.  The Arrow flight server can return the contents of a flight either by streaming it back to the client or by returning URLs to where the contents of the flight can be obtained.

In traditional databases, tables support both reading and modification. Reading typically involves `SELECT` statements, while modifications occur through `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `INSERT` operations. While Arrow Flight servers are not required to support all these operations, the Airport extension facilitates all of them.
