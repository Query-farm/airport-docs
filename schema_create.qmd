title: "Create"

The Airport extension supports the creation of schemas in the database it manages. DuckDB schemas can contain tables, functions, macros and other objects. The Arrow Flight server can decide if the schema should actually be created.

## Example

For a DuckDB session to create a schema, a standard SQL [`CREATE SCHEMA`](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/sql/statements/create_schema.html) statement while referencing a database/catalog that is managed by the Airport extension.

```sql
-- Attach an Airport database
ATTACH 'example' (TYPE AIRPORT, location 'grpc://localhost:50312/');

-- Create a new schema called main in the
-- example catalog
CREATE SCHEMA example.main;
```

## Arrow Flight Server Implementation Notes

The Airport extension will perform a `DoAction` Arrow Flight RPC call with a method name of [`create_schema`](server_action_create_schema.qmd).
