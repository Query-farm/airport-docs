- **DuckDB main development branch**: Tracked in the [`main`](https://github.com/Query-farm/duckdb-airport-extension/tree/main) branch.

## Dependencies

The Airport extension relies on the following [`vcpkg`](https://vcpkg.io/en/) packages:

- [`msgpack`](https://vcpkg.io/en/package/msgpack.html)
- [`arrow`](https://vcpkg.io/en/package/arrow.html)

## Dependency Versions

The specific versions of these dependencies are determined by the active commit of `vcpkg` used in the DuckDB extension build. The commit identifier is specified in the [`extension-ci-tools`](https://github.com/duckdb/extension-ci-tools) repository.

For the `v1.2` branch, Apache Arrow 18.0.0 is used.
