title: "Time Travel"
---

As of version 1.3.0, DuckDB supports time travel (also known as point-in-time) SQL queries, allowing users to query the historical state of a table.


Some examples are:

```sql
-- Query table as it existed at a specific timestamp
SELECT * FROM example.main.exployees AT (TIMESTAMP => TIMESTAMP '2020-01-01');

-- Query table by a specific version number
SELECT * FROM example.main.employees AT (VERSION => 42);
```

Arrow Flight servers may optionally implement support for time travel queries. If a requested timestamp or version is not available - or if the server chooses not to support time travel - it may raise an appropriate exception.

Point-in-time information is relevant in the following server actions:

- [`endpoints`](server_action_endpoints.qmd)
- [`table_function_flight_info`](server_action_table_function_flight_info.qmd)

It is also passed to [table returning functions](table_returning_functions.qmd) that have a table as a parameter (in/out table functions);
