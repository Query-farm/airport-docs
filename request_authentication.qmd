title: "Request Authentication"
---

The Airport extension for DuckDB provides support for sending requests that can optionally include an authentication header.

Currently the only supported authentication mechanism is a bearer token passed via the `Authorization` gRPC header.  Additional mechanisms may be added in the future to include mutual TLS and OAuth2, this will rely on underlying support from Apache Arrow.

The Airport extention integrates with the DuckDB secrets manager.  It does this by creating a new type of secret called `airport`.

An example of creating an `airport` secret is:

```sql
CREATE PERSISTENT SECRET airport_autogluon (
  type airport,
  auth_token 'example_token',
  scope 'grpc://localhost:50312/'
);
```

The `airport` secret type has these properties:

- `auth_token` - The bearer token value to use requests to the Arrow Flight server.
- `scope` - A string prefix that is matched against the destination location of the Arrow Flight server to determine which secret will be used.  This is useful to use a possibly use a single secret for an entire host or domain name.
