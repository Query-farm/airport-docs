description: "Configure authentication for Airport connections using bearer tokens and DuckDB secrets manager integration for secure Arrow Flight server access."
---

The Airport extension supports authenticated requests to Arrow Flight servers via authentication headers.

Currently, the primary authentication mechanism is a bearer token passed through the `Authorization` gRPC header. Additional mechanisms—including mutual TLS and OAuth2—may be added in future releases, pending support from Apache Arrow.

Airport integrates seamlessly with the DuckDB secrets manager using a dedicated `airport` secret type.

**Example: Creating an Airport Secret**

```sql
CREATE PERSISTENT SECRET airport_autogluon (
  type airport,
  auth_token 'example_token',
  scope 'grpc://localhost:50312/'
);
```

**Properties:**

- `auth_token` — The bearer token value used for authentication with the Arrow Flight server.
- `scope` — A URL prefix matched against the Arrow Flight server's location to determine which secret applies. This allows a single secret to be used for an entire host or domain.
