title: "Create Table"
---

The Airport extension supports creating tables through standard SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements. The Arrow Flight server determines whether to permit the table creation.

## Example

For a DuckDB session to create a table, a standard SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement is executed in a schema that is managed by the Airport extension.

```sql
-- Attach an Airport database
ATTACH 'example' (TYPE AIRPORT, location 'grpc://localhost:50312/');

-- Assume that there is a `main` schema
-- already in the `example` database
CREATE TABLE example.main.employees (
  name varchar,
  id integer
);

-- You can also use CREATE TABLE AS SELECT
CREATE TABLE example.main.more_employees AS (
  SELECT * FROM source_table
);

```

## Apache Arrow Extension Types

DuckDB supports several custom data types—such as `uuid`, `tinyint`, `hugeint`, `uhugeint`, `time_tz`, `json`, `bit`, and `varint`—using Apache Arrow’s extension type mechanism. These extension types preserve rich type information when exchanging data with other users of Apache Arrow.

To include extension type metadata when exporting data to Arrow, enable lossless conversion by setting the `arrow_lossless_conversion` configuration option:

```sql
SET arrow_lossless_conversion = true;
```

This ensures that DuckDB emits the appropriate Arrow extension types, allowing Arrow Flight servers to interpret the data with full type fidelity.

## Arrow Flight Server Implementation Notes

The Airport extension will perform a `DoAction` Arrow Flight RPC with a method name of [`create_table`](server_action_create_table.qmd).
