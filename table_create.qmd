title: "Create"
---

The Airport extension supports the creation of tables. The Arrow Flight server can decide if the table should actually be created.

## Example

For a DuckDB session to create a table, a standard SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement is executed in a schema that is managed by the Airport extension.

```sql
-- Attach an Airport database
ATTACH 'example' (TYPE AIRPORT, location 'grpc://localhost:50312/');

-- assume that there is a `main` schema
-- already in the `example` database
CREATE TABLE example.main.employees (
  name varchar,
  id integer
);
```

## Arrow Flight Server Implementation Notes

The Airport extension will perform a `DoAction` Arrow Flight RPC with a method name of [`create_table`](server_action_create_table.qmd).
